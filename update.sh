# Backspace — update a running instance
# ============================================================
# Takes a database snapshot, refreshes the checkout where that is possible,
# fetches the new image, restarts only the backspace service, waits for it to
# report healthy, and then verifies the running version actually changed. If any
# of that fails, it puts the previous image back.
#
# Usage:
#   ./update.sh              Update, with one confirmation prompt.
#   ./update.sh --check      Report whether an update exists. Changes nothing.
#   ./update.sh --yes        Update without prompting (for ssh and cron).
#   ./update.sh --no-backup  Skip the pre-update snapshot. Not recommended.
#
# Only the `backspace` service is ever named, and --remove-orphans is never
# passed. Production hosts run other containers in the same compose project and
# behind the same Caddy; an update to Backspace has no business recreating or
# reaping any of them.
