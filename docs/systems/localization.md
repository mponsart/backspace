# Localization

How Backspace is translated, and the rules every string, count, date and
error message follows so that the translations stay correct as the product
moves. This spec is the contract; the foundation PR implements it and each
surface sweep PR extends it.

Shipped languages: English (`en`, the source language and the fallback),
Russian (`ru`), German (`de`), French (`fr`), Simplified Chinese (`zh`). Adding a language is a
catalog directory plus one entry in `supportedLanguages`; nothing else in the
code should need to know the list.

`zh` is the Simplified catalog and detection maps every `zh-*` tag onto it,
Traditional included: a `zh-TW` browser gets a script its user can read
rather than English, and the picker says 简体中文 so they know which variant
they have. A Traditional catalog would be `zh-Hant`, and adding it means
teaching `resolveSupportedLanguage` to look at the script subtag, which it
does not today.

Source files:
- Runtime setup: `packages/web/src/i18n/index.ts` (`initI18n`, `setLanguage`,
  `getLanguage`; detection, persistence, `<html lang>`/`dir` sync, desktop IPC)
- Language list: `packages/web/src/i18n/languages.ts` (`supportedLanguages`,
  `SupportedLanguage`, `resolveSupportedLanguage`, `pickLanguage`)
- Lazy catalog loader: `packages/web/src/i18n/loader.ts` (`LazyCatalogBackend`)
- Typed keys: `packages/web/src/i18n/resources.ts` and
  `packages/web/src/i18n/i18next.d.ts` (`CustomTypeOptions`)
- Formatters: `packages/web/src/i18n/formatters.ts` (`createFormatters`,
  `formatters`, `useFormatters`)
- Error mapping: `packages/web/src/i18n/errors.ts` (`describeError`)
- Language picker: `packages/web/src/components/modals/settingsPanels/LanguageSection.tsx`
- Catalogs: `packages/web/src/locales/<lng>/<namespace>.json`
- Shared error codes: `packages/shared/src/errors.ts` (`ERROR_CODES`,
  `ErrorCode`, `ApiErrorBody`, `isErrorCode`)
- Server error helper: `packages/server/src/utils/httpErrors.ts` (`sendError`,
  `ERROR_MESSAGES`)
- Desktop main-process catalog: `packages/desktop/src/l10n.ts`; the recovery
  and instance-picker pages under `packages/desktop/resources/` carry their
  own inline catalogs
- Consistency check: `scripts/check-i18n.mjs` with its rules in
  `scripts/i18n/check.mjs` (runs in `pnpm typecheck` and in the web build)
- Test bootstrap: `packages/web/src/test/setup.ts` starts i18next in English
  before any component test renders

## Library

`i18next` with `react-i18next`. Chosen because the catalogs are plain JSON
that Weblate, Crowdin and every other translation tool can read, and because
its plural handling uses the CLDR categories (`one`, `few`, `many`, `other`)
that Russian needs. No ICU message-format plugin: interpolation plus CLDR
plurals cover everything the UI says, and ICU syntax in catalogs is a
translator hazard.

No other dependency. Dates, numbers and relative times come from the
platform `Intl` APIs.

---

## Keys

Keys name what a string means in the product, never what it says in English
and never where it lives in the source tree.

Shape: `<namespace>:<element>.<meaning>`, for example
`chat:composer.placeholder`, `settings:desktop.autoLaunch.label`,
`voice:controls.mute`, `errors:auth.invalidCredentials`.

Rules:
- The namespace is a product surface (table below), not a component or file
  name. Renaming a component never touches a catalog.
- Segments are camelCase, no spaces, no sentence text. A key like
  `yourPasswordIsVerifiedLocally` is wrong; `passwordLocalVerificationNote`
  is right.
- One key per distinct meaning. Two places that happen to say "Save" but
  mean different actions (save a draft, save profile changes) get two keys;
  translators may need different words.
- Never build a key at runtime from a variable (`t(\`status.${x}\`)`) unless
  the variable is a closed union and every member is listed in the catalog.
  The check script cannot see through it, so the call site names the keys it
  covers in a comment for the check script (see Consistency check).
- Keys are typed. `t('chat:composer.placeholde')` is a compile error and
  keys autocomplete in the editor. A component that mixes namespaces declares
  them both: `useTranslation(['settings', 'common'])`, then
  `t('common:actions.save')`. With only `useTranslation('settings')` the
  `common:` prefix is a type error, which is i18next 26 doing its job.

### Namespaces

| Namespace | Covers |
|-----------|--------|
| `common` | Shared strings used across surfaces, grouped as `actions` (Save, Cancel, Accept, Leave, Log In…), `states` (Loading, Enabled, the four presence labels, Settings saved…), `labels` (Username, Password, Members, Friends, Danger Zone…), `time` (Today at, Yesterday at, Never, Just now), `units` (ms, %, kbps, Mbps) and `colors` (the avatar and folder colour names); the language selector. `src/i18n/presence.ts` maps a presence status to its `states` key so every surface shows the same words |
| `auth` | Login, register, join-by-invite, password fields, federated account creation |
| `chat` | Message list, composer, attachments, embeds, reactions, replies, typing, jump-to-message |
| `dm` | DM list, group DM management, DM calls, DM system messages |
| `voice` | Voice channel controls, screen share, stream tiles, device pickers |
| `spaces` | Space, category and channel CRUD, invites, discovery, membership, bans, roles; the Explore page's Inner and Outer Space sections, the connect-and-join dialog, the connections-that-need-attention chips and the per-space directory switch (`explore.inner.*`, `explore.outer.*`, `explore.connect.*`, `explore.connections.*`, `settings.discovery.directory.*`) |
| `settings` | User settings modal and its panels (account, voice, privacy, connections, keybinds, desktop) |
| `admin` | Instance settings panels (general, registration, users, storage, streaming, updates, federation); the space-discovery ladder and the directory status line (`general.discovery.*`, `general.directory.*`) |
| `federation` | Connected instances UI, peering requests, identity attach and detach |
| `social` | Friends page, friend requests, user profiles, mutuals, user search |
| `search` | Search popover and filter help |
| `uploads` | Transfer indicator, upload errors, crop dialog |
| `desktop` | Renderer-side desktop strings: update banner, recovery notices, keybind setup |
| `mobile` | Mobile shell, bottom navigation, screen titles |
| `project` | The Backspace project hub page (`/backspace`) and its sidebar entry: header, the What's new, community, support, insights, report, host and desktop cards, the This instance section and the footer links |
| `telemetry` | The one-time "say hi" ask and the instance-settings section for the optional daily usage ping |
| `errors` | Localized messages for every `ErrorCode` in `packages/shared` |

One JSON file per namespace per language. `common` is the default
namespace; everything else is referenced with the `ns:` prefix.

---

## Plurals

Every string that contains a count goes through an i18next plural key. No
`${n} file${n === 1 ? '' : 's'}`, no `_one`/`_other` suffix tricks that leave
the noun outside the catalog.

Each language supplies the CLDR categories it needs. The check script takes
them from `Intl.PluralRules(lng).resolvedOptions().pluralCategories`, the
same data i18next selects a form with at runtime, so there is no table to
keep in step; for the shipped languages that is:

| Language | Categories |
|----------|-----------|
| en | `_one`, `_other` |
| de | `_one`, `_other` |
| ru | `_one`, `_few`, `_many`, `_other` |
| fr | `_one`, `_many`, `_other` |
| zh | `_other` |

A catalog directory whose code `Intl` does not know is a finding of its own,
because the runtime could not pluralize it either.

Example (`admin.json`):

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "deletedFiles_one": "Deleted {{count}} file",
    "deletedFiles_other": "Deleted {{count}} files"
  }
}
```

Russian:

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "deletedFiles_one": "Удалён {{count}} файл",
    "deletedFiles_few": "Удалено {{count}} файла",
    "deletedFiles_many": "Удалено {{count}} файлов",
    "deletedFiles_other": "Удалено {{count}} файла"
  }
}
```

The check script fails a catalog whose plural key is missing a category for
its language, and fails any `t()` call that interpolates `count` into a key
without plural forms.

Zero is a normal `_other` (or `_many` in Russian) unless the UI wants a
distinct phrase, in which case the key gets a `_zero` form and the call site
passes `count: 0` as usual.

---

## Dates, times and numbers

All formatting goes through `packages/web/src/i18n/formatters.ts`. Nothing
else in the web package calls `toLocaleDateString`, `toLocaleTimeString`,
`toLocaleString` or constructs an `Intl.*` formatter directly; the check
script enforces this.

The formatters take the locale from the selected language, not from the
browser default, so a German user on an English OS sees German dates. Each
formatter reads `i18n.resolvedLanguage` at call time; components use the
`useFormatters()` hook, which subscribes to language changes and re-renders.

| Function | Use | Backing API |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| `formatTime(ts)` | Message timestamps, "today" DM previews | `Intl.DateTimeFormat` `{ hour: 'numeric', minute: '2-digit' }` |
| `formatShortDate(ts)` | DM previews, day separators | `{ month: 'short', day: 'numeric' }`, year added when not the current year |
| `formatMediumDate(ts)` | Lists that always want the year: users, bans, peers, profile "member since" | `{ month: 'short', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric' }` |
| `formatLongDate(ts)` | Update panel | `{ day: 'numeric', month: 'long', year: 'numeric' }` |
| `formatFullDate(ts)` | Message list day separators | weekday plus long date |
| `formatNumericDate(ts)` | Compact tables | `{ dateStyle: 'short' }` |
| `formatDateTime(ts)` | Message hover, search results, redemption log | `{ dateStyle: 'medium', timeStyle: 'short' }` |
| `formatRelativeTime(ts)` | "Last checked 5 minutes ago": elapsed time in the largest whole unit | `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` with `numeric: 'auto'` |
| `formatRelativeDay(ts)` | "yesterday" in DM previews: the calendar day, so 23:00 and 01:00 are a day apart | `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`, `day` unit |
| `formatNumber(n)` | Counts shown as bare numbers | `Intl.NumberFormat` |
| `formatPercent(p)` | Sliders that show `150%` | `Intl.NumberFormat` `style: 'percent'` |
| `formatBytes(n)` | Storage panel, transfer indicator | `Intl.NumberFormat` with `style: 'unit'` and the right byte unit |
| `formatList(items)` | Reaction tooltip ("You, Mira, and 3 others"): an "and" list with the language's separators | `Intl.ListFormat` `{ style: 'long', type: 'conjunction' }` |

`formatDmTimestamp` in `dmFormatters.ts` keeps its today/yesterday/this-year
branching but delegates every branch to these formatters, and the "Yesterday"
branch is `formatRelativeDay` rather than a literal.

The elapsed and calendar variants exist because they answer different
questions: a message sent at 14:05 yesterday is "20 hours ago" as elapsed time
and "yesterday" as a calendar day, and each UI wants one of the two.

Tests set the language explicitly through `i18n.changeLanguage` before
asserting on formatted output. Asserting `Mar 15` without setting the
language is the bug the previous `dmFormatters.test.ts` had.

---

## Loading

English is bundled with the app as the fallback and is always present.
Every other language is loaded on demand, one namespace at a time, through
a small i18next backend in `loader.ts` built on `import.meta.glob` with lazy
imports. Vite splits each `<lng>/<namespace>.json` into its own chunk, so a
Russian user downloads Russian and nothing else, and an English user
downloads no catalogs beyond the bundled ones.

Missing keys in a non-English catalog fall back to English at runtime
(i18next `fallbackLng`), so a partially translated surface degrades to
English rather than showing a key.

The store shape for `CustomTypeOptions.resources` is derived from the
English catalogs (`resources.ts` imports every `en/*.json`), which is what
makes keys typed without maintaining a parallel type by hand.

---

## Language selection and persistence

Detection order on startup:

1. Stored choice under `localStorage['backspace-language']`.
2. `navigator.languages`, first entry whose base language is supported.
3. `en`.

Each entry in `supportedLanguages` carries a `released` flag. Only released
languages appear in the picker (`availableLanguages`) or can be chosen by
detection; a stored choice for an unreleased language is ignored. English,
Russian, German and Chinese are all released. The flag exists for the next
language: it lands surface by surface with `released: false`, so a release cut
in between stays free of that language rather than shipping it half
translated, and the PR that finishes it flips the flag. Tests reach an
unreleased language with `setLanguage` or `initI18n({ releasedLanguages })`;
people reach it with `?lang=<code>` on the URL, which works in development
builds only and is never persisted.

Detection alone never writes the stored choice. A user who has not picked a
language keeps following their browser; only the picker persists.
`initI18n` resolves after the detected language's catalogs are loaded, and
`main.tsx` awaits it before the first render, so there is no English flash.

The selector lives in the user settings modal, Account panel, section
"Language". It lists `supportedLanguages`, showing each language by its
`nativeName` (English, Русский, Deutsch, Français, 简体中文); the list is not translated,
because a user who cannot read the current language needs to find their own.

Changing the language:
- Persists the choice.
- Sets `document.documentElement.lang` and `dir` (from the language's `dir`
  field; all shipped languages are `ltr`, the field exists so an RTL language
  is one catalog and one entry).
- In the desktop app, sends `set-language` over IPC so the main process
  relabels the tray and application menus.

The choice is per device, not per account. It is not synced to the server;
a user's language is a property of the machine in front of them.

---

## Server errors

The server never localizes. It sends a stable machine-readable code, and the
client owns the words.

Wire contract (`packages/shared/src/errors.ts`):

```ts
interface ApiErrorBody {
  error: string;       // English text, kept for older clients and logs
  code?: ErrorCode;    // stable identifier, e.g. 'current_password_incorrect'
  statusCode: number;
  details?: Record<string, string | number>; // interpolation values, e.g. { max: 32 }
}
```

`ErrorCode` is a snake_case string union in `packages/shared`. The shape
follows the codes that already existed before this system (`recipient_deleted`
in the DM routes, the friend-request codes in `social.ts`,
`PEER_EXISTS_RESET_REQUIRED` in peering), all of which are members. A code
never changes meaning once shipped.

Routes send errors through `sendError(reply, status, code, details?)` in
`packages/server/src/utils/httpErrors.ts`, which looks up the English text
for the code and fills the body. `ERROR_MESSAGES` is typed
`Record<ErrorCode, string>`, so adding a code without English text does not
compile. Routes that have not been converted keep sending `{ error,
statusCode }`; the contract is backward compatible in both directions because
a desktop app and an instance version independently, and because the web
client talks directly to federated peers that may run any version.

The client's `HttpError` carries `code` and `details`, parsed by
`HttpError.fromBody`. It accepts a `code` field, and, for the older routes
that put the code in `error` itself, an `error` value that is a known code.
Unknown codes are dropped, so a peer cannot inject arbitrary catalog keys.
Components render an error with `describeError(err)` from `i18n/errors.ts`,
which returns the localized `errors:` string for the code, interpolating
`details`, and falls back to the server's English `error` text when there is
no code or the catalog has no entry. A `code` that is missing from the
`errors` namespace is a check-script failure, so every code shipped by the
server has words in every language.

Federation: error bodies relayed from a peer instance follow the same
contract, so a code from a newer peer is localized and a bare `error` from
an older peer is shown as is.

The space directory ([directory.md](directory.md)) added four codes:
`directory_disabled` (the feed proxy, `DIRECTORY_ENDPOINT` empty),
`directory_unreachable` (the proxy could not read the hub; the Outer Space
section shows this text as its unreachable state), `directory_private_space`
(`directoryListed: true` on a private space) and
`directory_requires_discovery` (`directoryEnabled: true` with discovery off).

One code is minted by the client and never by a route:
`federation_different_password`, carried by `RemoteLoginRequiredError` when a
remote instance refuses the credential the user's home issued for it (the same
class carries the route code `federated_registration_closed` when the instance
is closed instead; see [client-federation.md](client-federation.md), step 7 of
the connect flow). It sits in `ERROR_CODES` and in `ERROR_MESSAGES` like any
other, because
`ERROR_MESSAGES` is exhaustive and the English text is still the fallback, but
no route sends it. The pattern for a client-minted code is the one
`RateLimitError` established: subclass `HttpError`, pass a registered code, and
let `describeError` find the catalog entry.

Client state that is not an error follows the same split without joining
`ErrorCode`. The federation registry's `errorMessage` holds one of four
reason codes (`unreachable`, `session_expired`, `reauthenticate`,
`authenticate_home`) written by `instanceStore` and turned into words by
`describeRegistryError` in `i18n/registryErrors.ts`, against
`federation:connections.row.reason.*`. They are not `ErrorCode`s because
nothing throws or sends them and `ERROR_MESSAGES` is exhaustive over that
union, which would put English text in the server package for a string only
the web client writes and reads. A value the switch does not recognise is
rendered as it stands: registry rows sync between clients, and one written
before this change carries an English sentence that is still the row's only
explanation. See
[client-federation.md](client-federation.md#the-reason-field-errormessage).

`exploreStore.error` follows the same rule with a smaller vocabulary:
`{ kind: 'none_answered' }` or `{ kind: 'failed', cause }`, rendered by the
Explore page from `spaces:explore.inner.noneAnswered` and `describeError`
respectively. The test for a store that reports a failure is whether the
words could be chosen later, at the surface, in the language the reader has
now.

The check reads `ERROR_CODES` by scanning the array for quoted words, so it
strips comments from the file first (`readErrorCodes` in
`scripts/i18n/check.mjs`). Without that step a single apostrophe in a comment
inside the array desynchronises every quote pair after it and the run reports
a hundred-odd findings naming fragments of the file rather than the comment
that caused them. Prose in that array is ordinary English; the stripping is
what keeps it safe.

The global rate limiter (`@fastify/rate-limit` in `index.ts`, 200 per minute,
and every per-route override of it) answers in the same shape through its
`errorResponseBuilder`, built with `errorBody` from `httpErrors.ts` so the
code is typed there too: `{ error, code: 'rate_limited', statusCode: 429,
retryAfter }`, with `retryAfter` in seconds next to the `Retry-After` header
the plugin sets. On the client every 429 throws `RateLimitError`, an
`HttpError` with `status 429`, the body's own code when the route sends
one and `rate_limited` otherwise, plus `retryAfter`, so `describeError`
localizes it like any other server error and the auth pages keep their
countdown. The federated lookup's `lookup_rate_limited` is a different code
because it reports a peer's limit, not this instance's; it reaches the
client through the same class and shows its own catalog text.

Every route file is converted: auth, users, spaces, channels, messages, DMs
(including the space-invite endpoint), social, explore, admin, settings,
search, LiveKit, uploads, GIF and URL metadata. The `authenticate`,
`requireAdmin` and `requireLocalUser` hooks in `utils/auth.ts` send codes
too (`unauthorized`, `account_deleted`, `forbidden`) while keeping their
English text. Two responses carry extra fields next to the shared shape: the
username availability check (`available`, `reason`) and the owned-spaces
rejection (`ownedSpaces`). The only sites left without codes are the
test-only peer seeding route and the WebSocket handler's error messages,
which are a separate protocol.

The web client no longer matches on English error text. The places that
used to (the join page, the space invite card, the invite modal, the roles
panel, the federated account registration in `instanceStore`) check
`err.code`; the join helper in `utils/joinErrors.ts` keeps a text fallback
for a federated peer on a version that predates the codes.

---

## System messages

DM system messages (member added, removed, left, ownership transferred, call
events, space invites) are stored and relayed as structured JSON with a
`type` discriminator and identity fields, never as English text. The client
renders them through `dmFormatters.ts`, which now reads the `dm:system.*`
keys. This is the only kind of server-authored text shown in chat, and it is
already federation safe because peers relay the structure, not a rendering.

If a future feature stores a human sentence on the server, that is a bug in
the feature, not a localization task.

---

## Desktop main process

The main process shows a handful of strings outside the renderer: tray menu
items, the application menu (macOS, and the accelerator-only Edit menu on
Windows and Linux), the update items, the recovery page and the instance
picker. The menu strings live in `packages/desktop/src/l10n.ts` as a small
typed catalog with `en`, `ru`, `de`, `fr` and `zh` entries; `translateDesktop(language,
key, values?)` reads it. The recovery and instance-picker pages carry their
own inline `STRINGS` tables, because they are shown precisely when the
renderer is unavailable.

Language source, in order: the last `set-language` IPC message from the
renderer, persisted as `language.json` next to `instance-url.json` in
userData, then `app.getLocale()` mapped through the same base-language rule
as the web, then `en`. `getDesktopLanguage()` resolves it; the pages receive
it as `?lang=` on their `loadFile` URL. On `set-language`, main persists the
choice and rebuilds every menu it owns.

`buildTrayMenuTemplate` and `buildAppMenuTemplate` take the language as a
trailing parameter that defaults to English, so the pure template builders
stay testable without Electron.

Notification titles are composed by the renderer and passed to
`showNotification`, so they need no main-process work.

---

## Consistency check

`scripts/check-i18n.mjs` runs in `pnpm typecheck` and before the web build.
It fails on:

1. A key present in `en` and missing from another language, or vice versa.
2. A `{{placeholder}}` set that differs between languages for the same key.
3. A plural key missing a CLDR category for its language.
4. A `t()` call that passes `count` to a key without plural forms.
5. A non-English value byte-identical to the English one, outside the
   allowlist in `scripts/i18n-allowlist.json` (brand names, "OK", URLs, and
   the words German shares with English such as Link, Info, Token, Codec).
6. A direct `toLocale*` or `Intl.*` call in the web package outside
   `formatters.ts`.
7. An `ErrorCode` with no entry in `errors.json`.
8. A literal user-facing string in JSX or in a `addToast(...)` call, in any
   file not listed in `scripts/i18n-pending.txt`. That file listed the
   source files not yet swept while the sweeps ran; it has been empty since
   they finished, so the rule covers every file, and it stays as the
   mechanism for a surface that has to land untranslated for a while.
   `node scripts/check-i18n.mjs --write-pending` regenerates it from the
   current tree. A line that is a false positive carries
   `// i18n-check: allow-literal` on the line above. Files under
   `packages/web/src/dev/` are exempt from this rule alone: each is the entry
   of a design workbench page that the app never imports, and their copy
   addresses whoever is building the component rather than a user.
9. Translation markup that differs from English, or a paired HTML void tag
   (such as `<link>...</link>`) used as a `Trans` component wrapper. Void tags
   are parsed as empty HTML elements, so wrapper components use distinctive
   names such as `<actionLink>...</actionLink>` instead.

The check reports every finding at once, with file and line, so a sweep PR
can be fixed in one pass.

---

## Sweep order and translation workflow

Surfaces are converted one PR at a time, in the order users meet them: auth,
settings (done in the foundation PR as the reference), chat, dm, voice,
spaces, social, search, uploads, mobile, federation, admin, desktop. Each
PR ships every language in `supportedLanguages` for its namespace; the parity
rule fails the PR otherwise.

The Russian translation comes from the community. st7105 translated the
whole app in PR #45, and that PR also established the detection order, the
`backspace-language` storage key and the idea of a parity check, all of
which are kept here. The Russian values are carried over matched by English
text, with `Co-authored-by` credit on every commit that carries them, and
st7105 is asked to review the result. German is written by the maintainers;
the release PR that flips its flag is merged only after a native read.

**One name per concept, per language.** A concept the product names once in
English is named once in each catalog, and that name is not reused for
anything else. The space directory broke this rule in Russian first: it was
«внешний каталог» in ten strings, «общедоступный каталог» in two and a bare
«каталог» in three, and «каталог пространств» was also being used for
*discovery*, which is a different setting with a different switch, so a space
owner read that the directory was off and went looking for the listing
control. Settled as «внешний каталог» for the directory (the spelling already
in the majority, and the one that matches «внешнее пространство» for Outer
Space), «обнаружение пространств» for discovery (already the admin panel's
wording), and «папка» for a filesystem directory, so that «каталог» has
exactly one meaning. German (`Verzeichnis`) and Chinese (`目录`) each carried
one name already and were left alone. The rule cannot be checked by comparing
languages to each other, so the Russian one is pinned by
`src/i18n/ruDirectoryName.test.ts`; a language that develops the same split
gets its own.

«Обзор» had the same shape: it named the Explore page and also the Overview
tab in space settings and in group DM settings, while about a dozen strings
point at the Explore page by that name (в разделе «Обзор»). Kept as «Обзор»
for the Explore page, since it is the idiomatic label for a browse surface and
was already the majority reading, and the two tabs renamed «Основное», which
describes what they are (an editing panel for name, icon and banner) and
collides with no sibling tab. Pinned by `src/i18n/ruOverviewTabName.test.ts`.

Catalogs are Weblate compatible. No hosted translation platform is
configured yet; when one is, it points at `packages/web/src/locales` and
`en` is the source language.

---

## The landing page

`site/` is outside i18next entirely, and deliberately. It is a static marketing
page served by GitHub Pages with no bundler and no runtime: a translation there
is a second HTML file, not a catalog. `site/index.html` is English,
`site/ru/index.html` is Russian, and the two are an `hreflang` pair that each
declare both plus an `x-default` pointing at the root. Both appear in
`sitemap.xml` (`docs/systems/metrics.md` §3).

What the two pages share is in `site/assets/`: `site.css` and `site.js`, linked
by both, because neither says anything about language. The five strings the
script would otherwise hardcode travel on `data-` attributes of the elements
they belong to, and number formatting reads `document.documentElement.lang`
rather than branching on a locale, so the Russian page groups thousands with a
space without the script knowing which page it is on.

Terminology on the Russian page follows `packages/web/src/locales/ru/` rather
than being invented for the marketing copy: пространство, канал, демонстрация
экрана, пиринг, личные сообщения. A reader who installs from that page and then
opens the app should meet the same words twice. When a product noun changes in
the app catalogs, the landing page is the second place to change it.

**The default design font covers Latin only.** Google Fonts publishes DM Sans
with exactly two subsets, `latin` and `latin-ext`; there is no Cyrillic or CJK
cut to vendor. Left alone, a Russian or Chinese page would set its Latin words
and all its digits in DM Sans and everything else in the OS fallback, which is
two typefaces inside one sentence. Every non-Latin language therefore gets its
own `font-family` under `:root:lang(xx)` in `globals.css`, on `body` and `#root`
(the base rule targets `html, body, #root`, so overriding the two descendants is
what wins the cascade) and again on the emoji picker's `--font-family`, since
emoji-mart sets its own. `documentElement.lang` is set at init and on every
runtime switch, so the rule follows the language without a rerender. The
treatment differs by script:

- **Russian** uses bundled Inter (`packages/web/public/fonts/InterVariable*.woff2`,
  OFL, subset to Latin plus Cyrillic with a matching `unicode-range`) for the
  entire UI, Latin names and digits included. The faces are declared globally
  and applied only under `:lang(ru)`, so other languages never fetch them.
- **Chinese** takes the platform stack outright, naming each OS Latin face
  directly ahead of the CJK companion it ships with (SF and PingFang SC, Segoe
  UI and Microsoft YaHei, then the Noto CJK family). A Han webfont is several
  megabytes, and the OS pairs are designed to sit together, so vendoring buys
  nothing there.
- **English and German** stay on DM Sans.

Each surface is internally consistent, although the landing page keeps a
platform stack for Russian while the app uses Inter, so the same Russian words
are set in different typefaces in the two places. A future language in a script
DM Sans lacks needs its own `:lang()` pair of rules before release; the `zh`
block is the template for a script without a vendorable face, the `ru` block for
one with.

Two things the page does not inherit from this document. It has no plural
machinery, so a label under a stat tile is a bare nominative plural read as a
column heading, not as a phrase agreeing with the number above it. And English
house style forbids the em dash; Russian grammar requires тире where the copula
is omitted, so the Russian page uses it and the English page does not.

## Adding a language

1. Create `packages/web/src/locales/<lng>/` with every namespace file.
2. Add `{ code, nativeName, dir }` to `supportedLanguages`.
3. Add the entry to the desktop catalog in `l10n.ts` and the recovery
   window's inline catalog.
4. Run `pnpm typecheck`; the check script confirms parity.

Nothing else. If a fifth step turns out to be needed, the fix is to remove
the need, not to document the step.

The landing page is **not** part of this list. Shipping the app in a language
does not oblige anyone to translate `site/`, and a `site/<lng>/` page can be
added or dropped without touching a catalog. If a third one is ever added, that
is the point to weigh generating the pages from a template against copying the
markup a second time.
