# Backspace — Production Installer
# ============================================================
# Sets up Backspace on a Linux server in one of three deployment modes,
# auto-detecting which one fits your environment:
#
#   allinone  The bundled Caddy owns ports 80/443 and does automatic HTTPS
#             for your domain. The simplest setup — pick this if 80/443 are free.
#   proxy     You already run a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik, Caddy, Nginx Proxy
#             Manager, SWAG…). Backspace is published on 127.0.0.1:APP_PORT and
#             the installer prints ready-to-paste proxy config. No bundled Caddy.
#   tunnel    You expose the box through a tunnel (Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale…).
#             Same as proxy, plus tunnel-specific guidance. (Voice does not work
#             over a tunnel — WebRTC/UDP can't traverse it.)
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh                    Interactive setup (auto-detects the mode)
#
#   Non-interactive — set any/all of these to skip the matching prompt:
#     DOMAIN=chat.example.com \
#     DEPLOY_MODE=allinone|proxy|tunnel \
#     APP_PORT=8080 \                 # proxy/tunnel only; auto-picked if unset
#     ENABLE_VOICE=true \
#     INSTANCE_NAME="My Chat" \
#     TELEMETRY=on|off \              # the optional daily usage ping; leave it
#                                     # unset and the admin panel asks after the
#                                     # first login
#     ./install.sh
#
#   BACKSPACE_BUILD=true ./install.sh  Force a local from-source build instead of
#                                      pulling the prebuilt image (fork operators).

#      (`userland-proxy: false`, common on tuned hosts), Docker DNATs the port
#      with iptables and there is NO listening socket for `ss` to see. So we must

#      via iptables would be misreported as "ports free".
